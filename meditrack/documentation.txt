1. We started by created a model for the project:

- A model for Patient
- A model for Doctor
- A model for Appointment


- We registered them in database using python manage.py migrate


2. We are now creating the signals, signals allow us to react to something when something happens, mostly in Django like notifications, email sent etc
- For this signals will help us to knwo if a record or an appointment is created
- We are only doing this to a newly created appointment, so the trigger here is any appointment in database created
- onnce all this is done, we have to register the signals  our app.py by saying 
   def ready(self):
            import patients.signals -> now this, lets django loads our signals when the app starts


3. We are now creating a middleware - Why do we need a middleware, - We are creating a custom middleware in order to track all the endpoints, we do this because we want to see
-the perfoimance of our programme, if all the endpoints are being hit and which one is having traffic - later on we will use logging intead of print()
